# Welcome to my GitHub! ðŸ‘‹

  Hey there! I'm Wagner, a Software Developer and future Data Science/Machine Learning professional. Here is my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/wagnerlopesbr/)!

## **Academic Background:**
- Full-Stack Web Development course at [Trybe](https://www.betrybe.com/).
- Computer Science (bachelor) at [Cruzeiro do Sul](https://www.cruzeirodosulvirtual.com.br/).
- **Programming Language:** My main language at the moment is JavaScript and I'll focus on learning Python. I am also open to learning anything for my professional growth.


## **Technology Stack**

        <th>Git</th>

        <th>HTML</th>
        <th>CSS</th>
      </tr>
    </thead>
  </table>
</div>



## **Projects Highlights**
  I'm have a personal "sandbox*" study project called MEDSYS that simulates a real-world hospital system in which the user can run CRUD actions and other stuffs, showcasing my ability to apply theoretical knowledge to practical solutions. *sandbox -> I can try techniques/methods/libraries that I'm studying*

  During my time at Trybe, I've worked on numerous projects covering various aspects of full-stack development. I didn't save them all because some projects are too simple and basic *(really begginner level like HTML syntaxes, Programming Language basics like "Hello World" prints, etc)*, but I selected a few projects so you can check out my repositories for a glimpse of the skills and creativity I bring to the table.
