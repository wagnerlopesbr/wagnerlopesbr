## **Projects Highlights**
  During my time at Trybe, I've worked on numerous projects covering various aspects of full-stack development. I have a personal "sandbox*" study project called MEDSYS that simulates a real-world hospital system in which the user can run CRUD actions and other stuffs, showcasing my ability to apply theoretical knowledge to practical solutions. *(sandbox -> I can try techniques/methods/libraries that I'm studying)*
